                                <h3>Salter</h3> The biological father of all of the clones. His deep love of his sons is questioned as they discover their true nature. Salter is a depressed alcoholic who never forgave himself for the death of his wife and in trying to start over with a clone of his only son, drove himself deeper into a spiral of self loathing. Finding out that the doctors made more clones of Bernard 1 both angers, scares, and captivates him. He is left questioning his role as a father and grieving in the wake of his decisions.
                                 <br> <br> <br><br><h3>Bernard 1</h3>
                                Salter's natural born son. His mother died when he was two which was the traumatic event that is the source of a lifetime of fear, projected abuse, emotional distancing and hatred. He despises Salter for having the other clones made and he especially hates B2 who was raised by Salter.
                                <br> <br> <br><br> <h3>Bernard 2</h3>
                                Salter's cloned son, he raised him from the 'age' of 4. Upon finding out how he was created and that there are more 'versions' of him, Bernard 2 is intruiged and a little disgusted as well as fearful for his safety. He decides to flee the country, against Salter's wishes.
                                <br> <br> <br><br> <h3>Alex Black</h3>
                                One of the exterior clones that Salter has never met. It is unclear whether Alex knew that he was a clone before meeting Salter. Black is intruiged and not at all disgusted or angry that he is a clone, unlike his 'brothers'

										<span>Richard Pahl, NW Herald</span>
										<p>This powerful, unpredictable, suspenseful tale is likely to provoke thoughtful discussion all the way home. Theatergoers may wake up the next day still thinking about the play. It offers intellectual and emotional depth, and illustrates the ways people rationalize bad behavior and unthinkingly objectify others, including their own flesh and blood. It asks important questions. If we had a do-over, could we atone for our mistakes? What is the value of a human life? What is the source of our individuality?

										<span>Chris Jones, Chicago Tribune</span>
										<p>"A Number" also raises one of the scariest issue of all in human cloning — the idea that we might want another kid like our first one so that we might avoid all the parenting mistake we made the first time around. Like so much in this play, that offers plenty of food for thought.</p>

										<span>Lyn Gardner, The guardian</span>
										<p>Punchy, compact and endlessly inquisitive, Churchill's play is no simple warning against the perils of science messing with nature, but a complex and humane study of parental guilt, regret and responsibility and what it really means to be a father or son.</p>

										<p>These are more than just abstract questions. Thanks to Churchill’s formal playfulness, we must scramble to catch up with which version of Bernard we’re watching at any one time. In this way, the characters’ uncertainty becomes our own. On the one hand there are the ethical questions about Dolly-the-sheep-style cloning; on the other are the existential questions about who we think we are.</p>
